# Rental Price Prediction

This was a case study project for an imaginary online rental agency "Inn the Neighborhood". Details of the study and business challenge are described below. Additional details can be found within the code notebook.

### Company Background

Inn the Neighborhood is an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties for short stays. At the moment, only 2% of people who come to the site interested in renting out their homes start to use it.

The product manager would like to increase this. They want to develop an application to help people estimate how much they could earn renting out their living space. They hope that this would make people more likely to sign up.

### Customer Question

The product manager would like to know:
- Can you develop a way to predict how much someone could earn from renting their property that could power the application?

### Success Criteria

They want to avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price, as this may discourage people.

### Outcome

Unfortunately the model was not able to meet the success criteria. Multiple additional avenues are suggested for improvement, including segmentation, improved model, and additional data.
